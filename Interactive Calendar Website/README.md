# Interactive Calendar Website Code Utilizing AJAX
## Project for CSE 503S: Rapid Prototype Development & Creative Programming
- A 1-week project completed in collaboration with one partner.
- Goal: This project is an interactive, secure calendar application with dynamic AJAX functionality.
    - Key Features:
        - Monthly calendar view with seamless navigation across months.
        - User authentication and event management, allowing users to add, edit, and delete personal events securely.
        - Asynchronous operations via AJAX to prevent page reloads, with persistent sessions across refreshes.
    - Security and Best Practices:
        - Secure password hashing, protection against XSS, SQL Injection, and CSRF attacks.
        - Clean, well-commented code validated by W3C standards.
    - Usability:
        - Intuitive, user-friendly interface with a visually appealing design.
    - Creative Portion:
        - Implemented a search function that allows you to search for an event based on the title and it shows what month(s) and day(s) the event(s) is on based on the title.
        - Implemented tags to each post made and can specify whether the event is for "work", "school", "personal", "appointment", "other", or "none". Each tag has its own color to easily identify which is which.
        - Key for the Tags:
            - none: light indigo, 
            - school: light green, 
            - work: light red, 
            - personal: light teal, 
            - appointment: light orange, 
            - other: light pink
