# Simple News Website Code Utilizing MySQL Querying, PHP, & AWS Server
## Project for CSE 503: Rapid Prototype Development & Creative Programming
- A 1-week project completed in collaboration with one partner.
- Goal: This project implements a secure and intuitive web application for managing user accounts, stories, and comments. Key features include:
  - User Management:
    - Secure user authentication with hashed and salted passwords.
    - Session management for login and logout functionality.
    - Permissions allowing users to edit and delete their own content while restricting access to others' content.
  - Story and Comment Management:
    - Relational database design with foreign keys and appropriate data types.
    - CRUD functionality for stories and comments, with links stored in a separate database column.
  - Security and Best Practices:
    - Protection against SQL Injection and CSRF attacks.
    - Clean, readable, and well-commented code following the FIEO (First In, Early Out) philosophy.
  - Usability:
    - Fully validated HTML/CSS for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
  - Creative Portion:
    - A followers system exists where users can follow other users.
    - Users can follow and unfollow users by clicking on the follow or unfollow buttons on other users' posts.
    - Users can then click the "Following Posts" button to go to a feed that only shows the posts of users they are following.
    - Users are unable to follow themselves (a follow button does not appear and they cannot see their posts on the "following posts" page).
