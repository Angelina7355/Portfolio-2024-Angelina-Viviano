A followers system was created where users can follow other users. They can follow and unfollow users by clicking on the follow or unfollow buttons on other users' posts. They can then click the "Following Posts" button to go to a feed that only shows the posts of users they are following. They are unable to follow themselves (a follow button does not appear and they cannot see their posts on the "following posts" page).

# Remote Control Car Code Utilizing the Raspberry Pi and Linux OS
## Project for ESE 205: Electrical and Systems Engineering-Introduction to Engineering Design
- A semester-long project completed in collaboration with one partner.
- Goal: Design a remote-control car using Linux OS, a Raspberry Pi, and its accessories including the Pi camera, ultrasonic sensor,
A/D Converter, accelerometer, photoresistor, H-bridge, DC motors, servo motors, etc.
   - Pi Car drives at a desired rps using a closed-loop-system and a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) algorithm
   - Pi Car uses camera attached swivel motor to to find dark blue object(recycling bin) and angle wheels to drive toward it
   - Pi Car drives toward recylcing bin at desired rps while turning wheels when necessary to reach recycling bin and stops as
  close to the recycling bin as possible without touching it
      - Utilizes the "PiCar Class" Developed for the Course: https://github.com/ESE205/PiCar
