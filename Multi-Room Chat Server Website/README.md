# Multi-Room Chat Server Website Code Utilizing Node.JS and JSON
## Project for CSE 503S: Rapid Prototype Development & Creative Programming
- A 1-week project completed in collaboration with one partner.
- Goal: This project is a multi-room chat server that enables users to create, join, and manage chat rooms dynamically while facilitating secure and intuitive communication.
    - Core Features:
        - Users can create chat rooms with custom names, join existing rooms, and view all participants in a room.
        - Private rooms with password protection can be created, with room creators able to kick or ban users.
        - Messaging supports public chat visible to all room members and private messaging between users in the same room.
    - Best Practices and Usability:
        - Clean, well-commented code adheres to HTML validation standards, with version control optimized to ignore unnecessary files.
        - The platform is user-friendly and visually appealing, ensuring smooth navigation and interaction.
    - Creative Portion:
        - System messages/alerts: Whenever server changes are made such as the creation of a new room, joining and leaving a room, users disconnecting, people leaving from getting kicked, change in colors, etc.
        - Random name for guests: If a person decides to not make a username and go with "guest" the sever will randomly choose a number to differentiate between the guests and avoid the same names.
        - Chatbox customization: The owner of a room (public or private) can choose to change the background color of the chatlog to their liking with up to 3 colors to choose from. This color change also pops up for other users in the room after they send a message after the change has been made.
