Creative Portion:

Implemented a search function that allows you to search for an event based on the title and it shows what month(s) and day(s) the event(s) is on based on the title. Also implemented tags to each post made and can specify whether the event is for "work", "school", "personal", "appointment", "other", or "none". Each tag has its own color to easily identify which is which.

Key for the Tags:
none: light indigo, 
school: light green, 
work: light red, 
personal: light teal, 
appointment: light orange, 
other: light pink
